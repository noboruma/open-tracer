# HOW TO: Run load testing
## Prerequisites

- Install grpcurl:
â””$ go get github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl/cmd/grpcurl@latest

- Run as root

## Command example

```
sudo sh load_tests.sh ../../target/release/echo `which grpcurl` 10000 100
```

This command will run the load testing across 10000 files, using 100 threads (so 100 concurrent writes at max).

## Result analysis

Number of success indicates how many opens were caught
Number of failures should be 0
Buffer capacity represents internal buffers usage, it should be close to 50
